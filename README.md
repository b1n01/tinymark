## ðŸš€ Getting started

Use docker to setup local environment. Run commands from within the container with the `run` utility, like:
```bash
sh ./run [command]
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
sh ./run npm install
```

Run a script:

```bash
sh ./run node index.js
```

Run a script and watch it with [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon):

```bash
sh ./run npm run nodemon index.js
```
